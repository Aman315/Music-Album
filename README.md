SQL Music Store Data Analysis Project
Project Overview:
Developed a comprehensive data analysis project using SQL to extract meaningful insights from an online music store's database, facilitating data-driven decision-making and identifying key business growth areas. The project involved examining a complex dataset across 11 interrelated tables (e.g., Employee, Customer, Invoice, Track, Genre, Album, Artist) to answer critical business questions and understand customer behavior.
Technical Skills Applied:
Database Management: Designed and managed a relational database schema.
SQL Querying: Utilized a range of SQL functions and commands including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN (INNER, OUTER, LEFT), GROUP BY, ORDER BY, aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX), subqueries, and window functions.
Data Analysis: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in sales, customer preferences, and inventory.
Tools: Proficient in using PostgreSQL and PgAdmin for database management and querying.
Key Achievements & Responsibilities:
Analyzed sales data to identify top-performing artists and genres by revenue, generating insights to optimize the music catalog.
Determined the most popular music genre for each country and the customer who spent the most money, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and improved customer segmentation.
Developed queries to analyze employee performance based on sales metrics, identifying the top-selling agent and contributing to operational efficiency.
Extracted and manipulated data to calculate average song lengths and identify tracks longer than the mean, demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation and filtering techniques.
Presented data findings in a clear, concise format, translating complex SQL query results into actionable business recommendations.
This project demonstrates strong analytical skills and practical experience in using SQL for real-world data analysis tasks.
